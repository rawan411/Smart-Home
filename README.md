# Smart-Home
• Created a smart home-based Bluetooth where it can be controlled wirelessly using a mobile app using C programming
language.
• Two ECUs communicate with each other the first is a control ECU (master microcontroller) which takes the input from the Bluetooth using UART protocol and send it to the sink (Actuator)ECU Via SPI.
